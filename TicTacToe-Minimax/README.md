# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Minimax AI

This section of the repository focuses on the development of a **Tic-Tac-Toe game** implemented in C++, featuring an AI opponent that uses the **Minimax algorithm** with alpha-beta pruning. The game includes a graphical user interface built with **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**.

## Code

The code includes:

- **Gra.h / Gra.cpp**: Contains the `Gra` class, which manages the game logic, user interactions, and GUI rendering.

- **SI.h / SI.cpp**: Implements the AI logic using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to optimize decision-making.

- **Main Program**: Initializes the game and starts the main game loop.

- **SFML Library**: Used for rendering the game window, drawing the game board, and handling user input.

## Features

- **Game Logic**: Supports different board sizes and win conditions, allowing for customizable gameplay.

- **Artificial Intelligence**: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, providing a challenging opponent.

- **Graphical User Interface**: Interactive and visually appealing game interface created using SFML.

## Experiments

My examination covers:

- **Algorithm Performance**: Analyzed the efficiency of the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, especially on larger boards.

- **Game Difficulty**: Evaluated how changes in the depth limit and heuristic evaluation affect the AI's playing strength.

- **User Experience**: Tested the game's responsiveness and usability to ensure a smooth gameplay experience.

## Results and Report

Findings and analyses are compiled into the `TicTacToe_Minimax_AI_Report.pdf`, which includes:

- **Implementation Details**: Explanation of how the Minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning are integrated into the game.

- **Performance Metrics**: Discussion of the algorithm's computational complexity and optimizations used.

- **User Feedback**: Insights gathered from user testing to improve game design and AI behavior.

The report provides a comprehensive overview of the project's objectives, methodologies, and conclusions.
